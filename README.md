-pizza_id: The unique identifier for each pizza in the dataset.
-order_id: The unique identifier for each pizza order.
-pizza_name_id: The identifier for each specific pizza name.
-quantity: The number of pizzas ordered in each transaction.
-order_date: The date when the pizza order was placed.
-order_time: The time at which the pizza order was placed.
-unit_price: The price of a single unit of pizza.

3. SQL Queries: I have utilized SQL queries to extract relevant information from the dataset. This involved querying the database to obtain insights into customer preferences, revenue generation, and order patterns.

## Insights

Based on the analysis conducted, I have gained several valuable insights into the pizza sales data. Here are the key insights we obtained:

1. **Lunchtime Rush:** The most bustling period for the pizza shop is between 12 PM and 2 PM, indicating a significant influx of customers during lunch hours. This can be attributed to people taking their lunch breaks from work or school and seeking a quick and convenient meal option.

2. **Sunday as the Least Busy Weekday:** Sundays exhibit lower customer activity compared to other weekdays, suggesting that the shop's main customer base consists primarily of working individuals.

3. **Seasonal Sales Patterns:** Spring season experiences higher sales compared to other seasons, while sales during the fall season are relatively lower.

4. **Preference for Large Size:** The most preferred pizza size by customers is large. This indicates a tendency for customers to order pizzas in groups, potentially for sharing among family, friends, or colleagues.

5. **Single Category for Each Pizza:** Each pizza is classified into only one category out of the four available.

6. **Chicken Toppings Preference:** The Thai Chicken Pizza and the Big Meat Pizza, featuring the popular chicken topping, have emerged as top sellers, showcasing the importance of incorporating well-balanced flavor profiles that include chicken.

7. **Classic Category Dominance:** The Classic category emerges as the most ordered, highest revenue-generating, and most available pizza category. This popularity could be due to the timeless appeal and widespread recognition of classic pizza flavors, making them a go-to choice for customers.
